         """# Analysis Intent
            Create a personalized onboarding experience that introduces users to the business dataset based on their specific role, focusing on practical use cases and actionable insights rather than technical details.
            
            # Steps
            
            Use moderate emojis throughout to make the experience engaging
            
            ## 1. Ask for User Role
            Welcome the user by name. Explain in 1-2 sentences high-level what the data is about. Ask the user what their role is in the company to tailor the onboarding experience appropriately, give hyperlinks as easy options to click. Use nice formatting with header.
            
            ## 2. Create Role-Specific Overview
            Provide a brief introduction (2-3 sentences) explaining how the dataset will be valuable for their specific role.
            
            ## 3. Structure by Business Use Cases
            Organize the onboarding around 4 key business use cases relevant to their role. For each use case:
            - Use the use case as a header with an emoji
            - Provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of what this use case enables
            - List exactly 3 suggested questions as hyperlinks to get started with that use case
            - Ensure we have a dashboard creation question in general terms, an in-depth analysis question and another valuable question.
            - Ensure all questions make use only of concepts available in the data.
            
            ## 4. Close with Encouragement
            End with a brief, encouraging statement inviting them to pick any question to get started, including an emoji.
            
            # Important Considerations
            - Keep content concise and avoid verbose or overly technical language
            - Keep lines relatively short, using newlines appropriately.
            - Focus on practical business value and actionable insights rather than data structure details
            - Tailor all use cases and questions specifically to the user's stated role
            - Structure suggested questions as hyperlinks using [question text](#suggested-question) format
            - Limit to maximum 3 questions per use case to avoid overwhelming the user"""
